## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page application**: Built as a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Responsive design**: Uses viewport meta tag and flexible CSS layouts with 3D transforms
- **Modern 3D styling**: Utilizes CSS Grid/Flexbox, gradients, and 3D perspective effects
- **Component-based styling**: CSS classes organized around game components with depth and animations
- **Multiplayer interface**: Username input, game mode selection, and lobby system

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js server**: Custom HTTP server handling game sessions and API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL database**: Complete relational schema for users, games, players, tokens, and moves
- **Game state management**: In-memory game manager with database persistence
- **REST API**: Endpoints for creating games, joining games, and making moves

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for game structure with advanced form controls
- **CSS3**: Modern 3D styling with transforms, gradients, animations, and perspective
- **JavaScript**: Complete game logic with multiplayer API integration
- **Node.js**: Backend server for multiplayer functionality
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent game state and user management
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with schema management

## Key Components

### Game Interface
- **Game Container**: Main white container with rounded corners and shadow effects
- **Game Header**: Centralized title and current player display
- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox-based centering with mobile-friendly padding
- **Visual Design**: Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2) with clean white game board

### Styling Architecture
- **Reset Styles**: Global reset for consistent cross-browser rendering
- **Modern CSS**: Uses modern properties like `box-sizing: border-box`
- **Typography**: Arial font family with hierarchical font sizes
- **Color Scheme**: Purple gradient background with white foreground elements

## Data Flow

Currently, the application appears to be in early development with only the visual structure implemented. The data flow will likely involve:

1. **Game State Management**: JavaScript will manage player turns, piece positions, and game rules
2. **User Interface Updates**: DOM manipulation to reflect game state changes
3. **Player Interaction**: Click/touch events for piece movement and dice rolling

## External Dependencies

- **None currently**: The application uses vanilla HTML/CSS without external libraries
- **Potential future dependencies**: May include WebSocket libraries for real-time multiplayer functionality

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static hosting ready**: Single HTML file can be deployed to any static hosting service
- **No build process**: Direct deployment without compilation or bundling

### Future Considerations
- **Real-time multiplayer**: Will likely require WebSocket server implementation
- **Game state persistence**: May need database integration for saving game progress
- **Asset management**: Future versions might need image assets for game pieces and board

## Development Notes

The project is in its initial phase with only the basic HTML/CSS structure implemented. The incomplete CSS (ends abruptly with `display: inline-block;`) suggests active development. Key areas for completion include:

1. JavaScript game logic implementation
2. Multiplayer networking functionality
3. Complete CSS styling for all game elements
4. Game piece and board visual elements
5. Dice rolling mechanism
6. Win condition handling

The current architecture supports easy expansion into a full-featured multiplayer Ludo game while maintaining simplicity in deployment and maintenance.
